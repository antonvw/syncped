<p>
syncped is a synchronizing editor, with automatic synchronizing for all its
<a HREF="#EDIT">Editor windows</a> and its <a HREF="#LIST">List windows</a>.
Furthermore it integrates nicely with
<a HREF="#SVN">SVN</a>. Currently translation to Dutch is available, other languages
are easy to implement, translating two po files is all that is necessary.
You can also view a file in hex format by pressing the Hex checkbox on the toolbar.
Finally you can use <a HREF="#VI">vi</a> keys for navigating by setting the vi Mode in the options.

<p>
The configuration is read when starting up and saved when closing down.
all data is read and saved from the same directory as your executable is in.

<p>
You can specify on the command line the file(s) to open, wildcards * and ? are allowed.
You can also drop files from windows explorer to syncped, these are opened
automatically.

<p>
You can also select and run a process using Process Select and Process Execute.
The output (stdout and stderr) of the process is logged into the output
list 'Process Output'.

<hr>
<a NAME="EDIT"></a><b>Editor</b>
<p>
This is an MDI notebook editor implemented using a
<a HREF="http://www.scintilla.org">scintilla</a> component.
It has the next features:
<ul>
<li> Synchronizes if the file is changed from outside. Can be used for
     viewing log files: If you're on the last position in a log file
     and the log file is synchronized, then only new data is added to the
     file, and your position is restored to the end of file. 
     This also works in hex mode
     (enabled/disabled by toggling the Hex button on the toolbar).
<li> Any lexer from scintilla is suported, the colouring and 
     keywords are read from lexers.xml, editable using 'Lexers File Open'.
     Editing this file and saving it directly shows
     colouring style changes on all open editors.
<li> Fast searching by selecting text and pressing F3 or F4.
     Expressions are interpreted as regular expressions if the
     'Match whole word' check box is not checked.
<li> If you select several lines, you can sort the selection using
     any sort position in the selection. The default sort position
     is the cursor position at the last line of the selection.
<li> You can set the position of the edge column.
     This position is also used when adding check-in or out comments.
<li> You can set rectangular selection by pressing ALT before selecting.
<li> When the mouse is on a hex number the decimal number is
     shown as a tooltip py pressing Ctrl T.
<li> Links are navigated using popup menu on a Link.
</ul>

<hr>
<a NAME="VI"></a><b>vi mode</b>
<p>
In vi mode you can perform vi like navigating and editing. Almost all vi keys
are supported, including yanking, ranges, substituting and markers. 
Char buffers are not yet supported.

<p>
Most commands can be prefixed with a multidigit number, that takes care of
repeating that command the number of times it was prefixed.

<hr>
<a NAME="LIST"></a><b>List</b>
<p>
The output lists and the projects are implemented using a MDI notebook using a
standard list control component.

<p>
It has the next features:

<ul>
<li> Synchronizes if a list item is changed from outside.
<li> Columns<br>
All lists have at least the following columns:
<ul>
<li> Name
<li> Type<br>
For folders this field holds the pattern that was specified during Adding the folder.
<li> Modified<br>
<li> In Folder
<li> Size<br>
For folders this field is not used.
</ul>
<li> 'Find In ...' is available that allows you
to find text in all files in your project. If items are selected in
the project, then searching is limited to these files.
<li> The list can be sorted on each of its columns by
clicking on the column header.
You also have an Automatic Sort option for the project. If set, then
your project is automatically sorted ascending or descending
(depending on your SortMethod) and resorted whenever
one of the files in the project is synchronized.
<li> An item on the list can be opened by double clicking.
<li> List items can be copied to the clipboard as
ascii text with columns separated by tabs, and then pasted on other lists,
or into an edit window.
<li> You can compare items with each other, or with a base version from
a version list. A version list can be created from an item if the item
is part of a directory structure where the same item appears in
another directory as well where that directory matches the [0-9]*\\.[0-9]*.*" regular expression.
</ul>

<p>
The project file is stored as a text file containing the full paths of all items,
you can edit it using 'File Open As Text' in order to replace or change items.
The file format is: ['fullpath'[\t'folder extension']\n]+.

<p>
File attributes like modification times and access rights are not stored in this file,
they are read from disk each time you open the file.


<hr>
<a NAME="SVN"></a><b>SVN</b>
<p>
This handles the SVN interface using a svn client. The next svn commands are supported:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#9acd32">
  <th align="left">svn command</th>
  <th align="left">action</th>
</tr>

<tr><td>Add     </td><td>invokes svn add</td></tr>
<tr><td>Blame   </td><td>asks for revision and shows revision with blame info in editor window</</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cat     </td><td>asks for revision and shows revision in editor window</td></tr>
<tr><td>Commit  </td><td>asks for commit text and commits</td></tr>
<tr><td>Diff    </td><td>shows svn diff</td></tr>
<tr><td>Help    </td><td>invokes svn add</td></tr>
<tr><td>Info    </td><td>shows svn help</td></tr>
<tr><td>Log     </td><td>shows svn log</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ls      </td><td>invokes svn ls</td></tr>
<tr><td>Proplist</td><td>shows svn properties</td></tr>
<tr><td>Propset </td><td>sets svn properties</td></tr>
<tr><td>Revert  </td><td>invokes svn revert</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stat    </td><td>shows svn stat</td></tr>

</table>

The SVN submenu is shown when right clicking on an editor window, and 
the associated file is within a folder that is under subversion.
It is also shown if the SVN option has been set in the main Edit menu.
