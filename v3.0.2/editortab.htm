<ul>
<li> Synchronizes if the file is changed from outside. Can be used for
     viewing log files: If you're on the last position in a log file
     and the log file is synchronized, then only new data is added to the
     file, and your position is restored to the end of file. 
     This also works in hex mode.
<li> Fast searching by selecting text and pressing F3 or F4.
<li> If you select several lines, you can sort the selection using
     any sort position in the selection. The default sort position
     is the cursor position at the last line of the selection.
<li> You can set rectangular selection by pressing ALT before selecting.
<li> When the mouse is on a hex number the decimal number is
     shown as a tooltip by pressing Ctrl D.
<li> Links are navigated using the popup menu on a Link.
<li> Zoom in and out using Ctrl - and Ctrl = keys.
<li> Find marked text using Ctrl 9 and Ctrl 0 keys.
<li> Click on the first line to show current properties.
<li> If the Hex checkbox on the optionsbar is set, then files are directly 
     opened in hex mode.
<li> The tab can be split by selecting 
     Split from the context menu on the tab, as many times as you want.
     This causes the tab, and the splitted tab to be unsynced.
     To resync, you should uncheck and check the Sync checkbox.
