    The config directory is ~/.config/wex or application exe
    directory on windows.

    You can also enable verbose logging mode (-v) which allows
    you to keep track of opening / saving files, and 
    processes executed. Using option -V allows you to
    set the log severity level, with 1 trace level, downto 6 fatal level.
    The logfile syncped.log is present in the config directory, and 
    is written to stdout.
      
    You can also set verbosity using :set ve
  </p>
      
  <p>
    The config is stored as syncped.json in the config directory,
    but you can use a local json file by specifying the -j 
    command line parameter.

    Default syncped starts up in visual mode, by specifying --ex
    on the commandline it starts up in ex mode. In ex mode large
    files are supported, as the file is read line by line, and
    it is not kept in memory.
    There is also a margins setting 'Size visual' that determines
    the size of a file limit for visual opening. If file size exceeds
    this limit, it default opens in ex mode. Large files 
    containing million lines can be edited this way.
    The margin setting 'Size lexer' determines the max size of a file
    for which syntax highlighting is performed. If the file size exceeds
    this limit, no highlighting is performed.

    You can also set a Beautifier to setup a binary that takes
    care of beautyfying source code, e.g. select a clang-format binary.
    You can also set a Beautifier to setup a binary that takes
    care of beautyfying cmake code, e.g. select a gersemi binary.
    For git repo's this respects any .clang-format or .gersemirc
    file in the git root repo.
    It is used after you changed a file, and closed the tab from the notebook,
    or if you do a Replace In Files that also has .clang-format related file.
